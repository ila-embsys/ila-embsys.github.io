        "summary": "A am a programmer of embedded systems firmwares.\n ‣ I have experience in implementation by datasheets and electrical schemes of drivers for onboard chips or attached devices like sensors, servo-motors, etc. Familiar with interfaces like UART, CAN, USB, SPI, I2C, PWM, FMC. I have experience with network protocols like OpenCAN, Modbus, Ethernet, TCP-IP...\n ‣ I prefer to use Zephyr RTOS and know how to configure it including modules, board DTS files, drivers, KConfig parameters. I wide use tools like Git, Make, CMake, GCC/Clang.\n ‣ I have experience of hardware debugging by using oscilloscopes and logic analyzers. I can catch software bugs with SystemView RTOS analyzer and sigrok protocols decoder.\n ‣ I have knowledge in how Linux work and ready to work with it. The knowledge like how is work together bootloader, dts, kernel, initramfs, file systems, HFS, mouniting, system tools, etc... \n ‣ I am experienced a little in FPGA programming. I learned it since studied at university. Have worked with Xilinx Spartan and Altera MAX boards. I have done the course project where I was programming JTAG TAP controller on Xilinx board. Also, I have done one more FPGA project on Altera board during the work experience. \n ‣ Also, I am ready to support developers environment and infrastructure since have experience with preparing build environment by Docker containers for a VSCode devcontainer usage or CI pipelines running (GitLab CI). I have experiense in supporting Virtual Infrastructure of XenServer. \n ‣ At free time I like work on some of my pet projects. I am interested in IoT and learning for backend part, like Kubernetes infrastructure (k3s, storage provisioners, helm, etc...). \n ‣ I enjoy riding a bicycle in a forest or fun in riding a motorcycle gymkhana. I am In love with short kayak walkies. Ready to fun with windsurf, skates, snowboard and other similar activity.\n ‣ 8 year work experience, 28 years old, single: no wife, no child, no pets.",
